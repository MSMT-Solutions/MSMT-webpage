# Miniature Penetrometer

The miniature penetrometer series is specifically designed to investigate soil strength profiles in either centrifuge or laboratory equipment to a very high precision. The product offers an exceptionally miniaturised design with a 5 mm shaft and three different penetrometer tips: (i) D5 mm Cone, (ii) D5 x 20 mm T-bar, and (iii) D10 mm Ball. The different tips allow testing in clay or sand-based materials.

Manufactured from’marine grade’ stainless steel, these miniature penetrometers are of robust construction, resisting pitting and other corrosive effects of water.

The tension and compression load-cell provides high precision measurements with temperature compensation. It has a non-linearity and hysteresis of +/- 1% of the rated output.

The penetrometer assembly is serviceable by the user and damaged parts (e.g. load cell) can be easily replaced.

In addition to the standard devices shown, MSMT Solutions has the engineering capability to design penetrometers to specific individual requirements. Through careful consideration of the configuration, operating environments, compatibility and other important performance characteristics, our engineering team can design, build and test instruments for your needs.
