# Miniature Shear Vane

The Shear Vane series is specifically designed to accurately measure the undrained shear strength of cohesive soils. This type of test involves inserting a vane into the soil and measuring the torque required to rotate it, providing a reliable indication of the soil's shear strength.

The Shear Vane series offers a variety of vane sizes and shapes to accommodate different test locations and soil conditions, such as variations in strength and test depth. This ensures that the vane is suitable for the specific requirements of each testing scenario.

The vanes are constructed using marine-grade stainless steel, which exhibits excellent material strength and corrosion resistance. This choice of material enhances the durability and longevity of the vane, making it well-suited for use in diverse soil conditions.

The Shear Vane series is meticulously designed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of torque readings during the test. Its components are carefully manufactured with precise alignment and secure coupling, eliminating potential sources of measurement errors. This focus on component coupling and alignment guarantees that the obtained torque readings are both reliable and accurate.

To further enhance the reliability and credibility of the measurements, all Shear Vane models come pre-calibrated and are accompanied by a calibration certificate. This means that the vanes are tested against a known torque prior to being supplied, providing assurance that the measurements obtained during field testing are accurate.

In addition to the standard devices shown, MSMT Solutions has the engineering capability to design shear vanes to specific individual requirements. Through careful consideration of the configuration, operating environments, compatibility and other important performance characteristics, our engineering team can design, build and test instruments for your needs.
