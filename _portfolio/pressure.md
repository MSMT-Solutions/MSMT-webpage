# Miniature Pressure Transducer

The miniature pressure sensor series is specifically designed to investigate differential pressures within the range of
100 kPa. 

They are commonly used in geotechnical or hydrodynamical applications to measure pore pressure or fluid
pressure (static or dynamic), respectively. The product offers two exceptional miniature designs with the pressure
sensor housed in a cylindrical cup or in a M8 Socket Head Cap Screw.

Manufactured from Titanium (Grade 5), both sensor designs provide a rugged and lightweight construction, resisting
pitting and other corrosive effects of any fluid.

The analog pressure sensor can measure the differential pressure of up to 100 kPa between wet/air, air/wet and
wet/wet media. The unamplified sensor signal is temperature compensated offering high accuracy even for low differential
pressures.

In addition to the standard sensors shown, MSMT Solutions has the engineering capability to design pressure sensors
to specific individual requirements. Through careful consideration of the configuration, operating environments,
compatibility and other important performance characteristics, our engineering team can design, build and
test instruments for your needs.
