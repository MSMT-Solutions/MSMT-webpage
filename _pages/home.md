    excerpt: "The miniature penetrometer series is specifically designed to investigate soil strength profiles in either centrifuge or laboratory equipment to a very high precision. The product offers an exceptionally miniaturised design with a 5 mm shaft and three different penetrometer tips: (i) D5 mm Cone, (ii) D5 x 20 mm T-bar, and (iii) D10 mm Ball. The different tips allow testing in clay or sand-based materials."
