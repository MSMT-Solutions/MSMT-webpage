    title: "Cambridge's frost heave research with MSMT's instrumentation support"
    excerpt: "The University of Cambridge initiated a research project to understand the relationships involved in suction development and ice lens formation during frost heave. In support of this project, MSMT Solutions designed and fabricated a specialised oedometer cell wall, instrumented with an array of ten temperature and pressure sensors. Additionally, MSMT developped a custom-built microcontroller, proficient in data logging and capable of Bluetooth transmission to Cambridge's pre-existing DAQ system. The research is still underway, with results and accompanying publications expected in the near future."
